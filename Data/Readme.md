## Here are all the raw, intermediate, and output data tables used for the modelling and visualization in this study:
# **Data**
- `microhabitat_selection` :Output dataframes generated by our microclimate selection model for each season, habitat loss and climate change scenarios. 
- `operative_temperatures` :Output dataframes generated by our biophysical model for each season and climate change scenario.
- `Figure_2_data` : Calculated dataframes used to create Figure 2

- `Summer station data.csv` and `Winter station data.csv` : The raw data files from the meteorological station
- `Winter ground temperature.csv` and `Summer ground temperatures.csv` : The raw data files of ground temperature from the ibuttons
- `Summer microclimate fieldata.csv` and `Winter microclimate fieldata.csv` : The combined ground temperatures of each microhabitat and the corresponding meteorological data used in our biophysical model
