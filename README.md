### Abstract:
As habitat loss and climate change threat global biodiversity, we need a theoretical framework for predicting the combined impacts of these two threats on microclimate diversity and performance of organisms. Using a combination of empirical and modelling approaches, we show the cascading effect of habitat loss and climate change on activity and thermoregulation accuracy in a desert lizard. During summer, removing medium and large rocks will severely decrease activity, while the limited activity in winter is only restricted to the open ground. Future warming will gradually decrease summer activity as even large rocks become thermally stressful but may increase winters’ activity. However, these warmer winters will gradually require bushes and small rocks as shade retreats. Hence, size and types of microhabitat that may seem unimportant today may become important under climate change. Such modelling framework may be crucial to understand microchabitats’ requirements of species and develop conservation programs.
